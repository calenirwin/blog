          <p>The objective of Richard Stallman’s paper titled “Why Software Should be Free” is to answer the
            question: how should the use of software be regulated in order to maximize the benefit of software for
            all people? As an answer to this question, Stallman establishes the view that the concept of ownership
            when applied to software is detrimental to society, and that software developers ought to write “free”
            software. He defines free software as software that is free to use in any capacity and not simply
            software with no direct monetary cost (Stallman 43). In this paper, I will argue for the view that not all
            software should be free. First I will summarize and interpret the meaning behind the content of
            Stallman’s work, then I will critically evaluate his claims and provide reasoning for my argument.</p>
            <p>Stallman aims to support his claim that all software should be free by dismantling arguments in
                favour of software ownership and detailing forms of material harm that come from obstruction of
                software use. He suggests that Owners justify their right to ownership using an emotional argument and
                an economic argument (Stallman 43-44). The emotional argument that Stallman claims programmers
                appeal to goes as follows: I put effort and energy into X, therefore, I should own X. Stallman implies
                that programmers have an irrational emotional attachment to the programs that they develop and that
                they should detach their personal feelings towards their work, like a Renaissance painter. But he does
                not think that this argument requires ‘serious refutation’ (Stallman 43). The economic argument for
                software ownership claims: If I don’t get paid X amount of money, I won’t program. Stallman believes
                that this argument is a bluff that has no real substance. He contends that in the same way that people
                choose careers in art and politics despite low economic prospects, people will produce free software
                due to a passionate interest or a desire to benefit society (Stallman 51).</p>
            <p>Next, Stallman endeavors to describe the harm that comes from restricting the distribution and use
                of software and to show that the resulting level of harm outweighs the good. He believes that any and
                all limitations of use have negative connotations (Stallman 46). The three forms of harm brought on by
                restrictions on use are as follows: less people have access to the program, no users can modify the program, and other programmers cannot learn from the program. Stallman additionally claims that each
                material harm has an underlying psychosocial harm with broad implications, but due to the scope of
                this assignment I will not address this point. The first material harm is focused on the barrier that a
                monetary cost places on software. In this instance Stallman is appealing to free software in an
                economic sense. He claims that if a piece of owned software has a cost, then the amount of people that
                purchase the software will be much smaller than the pool of potential users (Stallman 46). The second
                form of material harm is the lack of sanctioned modification that proprietary software has. Stallman
                suggests that by not releasing the source code of their proprietary software, software owners are
                harming other developers. Developers often take existing code and either modify it to suit their needs
                or use bits and pieces in a completely separate program. Stallman cites an example where access to
                proprietary source code would have greatly reduced the six month development time of a program that
                his friend worked on (Stallman 49). The third material harm of software obstruction is its preventative
                affect it has on software education. This harm is closely connected to the second material harm as they
                both limit potential improvement upon existing software. He thinks that Software owners often want to
                safeguard their knowledge to maintain an advantage, but this behavior has a negative impact on society
                and the evolution of software as a whole.</p>
                <p>Thus far, I have addressed the points in Stallman’s paper that I take to be most relevant to my
                    evaluation of his argument. In what follows, I will identify a number of flaws in the arguments given
                    by Stallman and thereby suggest that not all software should be free.</p>
                <p>Stallman’s reconstruction of the emotional argument straw-mans a view that could be given a much
                    more convincing and robust defense. At the centre of the emotional argument is the claim that we have
                    a right to the fruits of our labours, because of the close relationship between the source/means of
                    production and what is produced. This view requires serious refutation</p>
                <p>I think he is mischaracterizing the economic argument by saying that people believe that if they
                    aren’t incentivized there will not be software at all. That’s not actually the argument. The actual
                    economic argument is that if software isn’t given the value it currently is and if people are not payed
                    high wages then not as many people will produce software. There will still be software, that software
                    just may not be as diversified. He formulates the economic argument as a question-begging ‘threat’ that
                    sets up an either/or scenario, when it could be formulated instead as a projection about the extent to
                    which incentives motivate a high degree of creative work in the field.</p>
                <p>In the section on the harms of...Stallman presupposes that software will be produced and that
                    decisions regarding ownership will follow initial production. Although the harms he mentions may be
                    of concern, if one takes the economic to be a realistic projection and less of an arbitrary threat aimed at
                    securing monetization, then one might wonder whether any good would be produced in the first place.
                    What’s more, the burden should be on Stallman to explain why material harm outweighs the harm that
                    could be inflicted upon programmers if they are economically alienated from the fruits of their labours.
